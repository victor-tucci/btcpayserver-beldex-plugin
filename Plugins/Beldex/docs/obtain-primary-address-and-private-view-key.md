# Generate a Beldex primary address and obtain its private view key using beldex-wallet-cli

## Overview

Note: This tutorial includes instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Skip any steps that do not apply to your operating system.

In this tutorial, you will generate a Beldex primary address and retrieve its associated private view key. These are commonly used when setting up a store or service that needs to receive Beldex payments and monitor incoming transactions.

To accomplish this, we will use the Beldex command-line wallet `beldex-wallet-cli`. This tool is required to create the address and keys, and all wallet creation steps can be completed offline.

To begin, open a terminal window (Mac/Linux) or command prompt (Windows) and type the following commands:

```bash
# LINUX: Download the Linux 64-bit command line client and extract it
wget https://github.com/Beldex-Coin/beldex/releases/download/v7.0.0/beldex-linux-x86_64-v7.0.0.zip
unzip beldex-linux-x86_64-v7.0.0.zip
cd beldex-linux-x86_64-v7.0.0

# MAC: Download the Mac command line client and extract it
wget https://github.com/Beldex-Coin/beldex/releases/download/v7.0.0/beldex-mac-intel-v7.0.0.zip
unzip beldex-mac-intel-v7.0.0.zip
cd beldex-mac-intel-v7.0.0

# WINDOWS: Create a new folder with Windows File Explorer, and use your web browser to download the following file to the new folder
https://github.com/Beldex-Coin/beldex/releases/download/v7.0.0/beldex-win-x64-7.0.0.zip

# You are strongly advised to verify the hashes of the archive you downloaded:
# https://github.com/Beldex-Coin/beldex/releases

# WINDOWS: Double click the Beldex zip file that has been downloaded to extract it. Then open Command Prompt. Use the 'cd' command to navigate to your new folder
cd beldex-win-x64-7.0.0

# Run the Beldex command line wallet.
# LINUX/MAC:
./beldex-wallet-cli --offline
# WINDOWS:
beldex-wallet-cli.exe --offline

# Follow the instructions displayed to create a new wallet. When told the 25 word SEED, write this down on paper and keep it in a very safe place. Even if you forget your passwords, the 25 word SEED can be used to recreate your wallet from any machine and have complete control over your Beldex funds. Sample output from the Beldex wallet is below:
